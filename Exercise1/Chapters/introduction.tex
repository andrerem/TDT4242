\section{Introduction}

In this exercise we will use the ISO-15622 to make some requirements to the ACC system based 
on the goals given in the exercise. We have categorized the ACC goals and listed requirements 
according to the goals. Linked to every goal there exists a diagram to show the connection 
between the goal, the requirements, and the ACC system components.
