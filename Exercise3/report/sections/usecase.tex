\chapter{Use case}

We chose to make use cases, both diagrams and textual, in the standard UML notation. 
The use cases will help us in many ways; it will improve the communication about the 
system in the group, as well as making a common agreement about the system requirements.

The use cases can also be a good tool when making tests, the “Description”, “Data”, 
“Flow of events”, and the “Response” fields in the use cases can easily be 
transferred over to the tests. The use cases can also be a good measure of the gap 
between the requirements and the developed software, when we are deciding whether to 
ship or not to ship the system.

The use cases are based on the scenarios from the SoCam documentation paper. The scenarios covers all the requirements, requirements 1 to 8, and are therefore a good basis for making use cases and tests.

			{\bf Description} & A CM responsible wants to add a new SW-component to the 
			SW archive, the person also have to update the Action DB with the actionscript 
			that connects the SW-component to the ECU.\\ \hline
			{\bf Preconditions} & {\bf 1)} Running computer {\bf 2)} Log on to the system {\bf 3)} ECU already in system\\ \hline

				\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries]
