\chapter{Introduction}

	This document is our delivery of a test plan and test strategy for the ACC system. 
	The ACC system is a tool used for maintenance of software code running in cruise 
	control units in modern automobiles. 

	The test strategy is focusing on the "why" to perform, while the test plan is 
	focusing on questions like "how", "when", "where", "who", and "what" in a testing phase. 

	The test strategy gives a description of the stakeholders, the test types and the
	test leves. The section will also contain sufficient information about 
	necessary resources and test environment. 

	The test plan consists of a description of all tests planned, in addition 
	an evaluation of consequences and success/failure criteria for each test. 

	Both parts, the test plan and test strategy, is developed with respect to the 
	requirements from exercise 1. The requirements are added in sections with their 
	respective test cases.
